# MCBE Addon Archive
This is an archive of my old MCPEDL content created from my time making addons for MCBE around 2019-2021
## UPDATE!!!
Thanks to Internet Archive's Common Crawl Web Crawler, there are now archived versions available for the Parkour+ and SKPVP pages!
Links to the archive versions here: [Parkour+](https://web.archive.org/web/20201031152917/https://mcpedl.com/parkour-1/?cookie_check=1), [SKPVP](https://web.archive.org/web/20201031164118/https://mcpedl.com/sonic-kit-pvp/?cookie_check=1).
## Notes
1. Parkour+ 1.0.0, 1.0.1 and SKPVP 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 is currently lost and I do not have the original files myself.
2. The original pages for Parkour+ and SKPVP aren't available on MCPEDL anymore as you can see on my old account page [here](https://mcpedl.com/user/popularsonic/)
3. Airship Reborn is a map made for the sole purpose of reviving an old world I had during 3rd grade, it was not made available to MCPEDL. The version in the archive is the initial release which has an inaccuracy in the recreation fixed in a later version that is not available anymore.
4. The file "PS118.mcpack" is a personal resource pack I created for myself, it was also not available for download in MCPEDL.
5. The video file "Con-fusion 60fps" is a recording of an early version of the last map I ever worked on. The map had unfortunately been lost and was unrecoverable, making this recording the only evidence of the map's existence.
6. This archive includes addons that never got released due to not meeting MCPEDL's standards such as EMBIC (Every Minecraft Block Is Cake).
